blockquote: An eye-catching, self-learning installation on data and privacy you can easily set up and host for your own event, organisation or space. What is personal data in an age when our data is everything but personal? Our websites, apps, social media and 'smart' devices all thrive on the same thing that makes tech companies billions – data. Not just any data, but our data.

In 2030 there will be an estimated 125 billion connected devices – 14 for each person. That’s a lot of smart toothbrushes. Will all these new technologies really make our lives more efficient, healthier and safer? The Glass Room Experience explores the companies and mechanisms that make our everyday technologies as well as connect the Internet of Things (IoT). Play Fake or Real to see how smart you are in the world of smart devices. Find out more about what's really happening behind the screen in The Internet You Don't See. Pick up a free Data Detox Kit, our easy, 8-day digital privacy guide that gives you simple steps to take control of your online life, not to mention your smart devices. The Glass Room Experience is being exhibited at events, libraries, schools, organisations and companies around the world. You can see where other events are taking place at www.theglassroom.org to join the global conversation about data and privacy.

The Glass Room Experience also includes:

- Video Loops of our animations and The Glass Room trailer, that can be displayed on TV monitors
- The Data Day poster showing the terms and conditions of online services we use throughout the day - this can also be printed out at a smaller size for visitors to take away
- A Data Detox Bar, where visitors can take away a Data Detox Kit: www.myshadow.,org/datadetox


**Data Detox Kit**

An essential part of The Glass Room Experience is the Data Detox Kit. Most hosts of The
Glass Room Experience will be able to print their own copies of the Data Detox Kit from
a normal printer or a print shop from a PDF we can send to you.


**Host your own Glass Room Experience**

Hosting your own Glass Room Experience is very easy. We’ve found it works best in busy
places with plenty of free space, or as part of a bigger event. It can be set up for
anytime from 2 -3 days to a longer period. It can also be set up as a longer term
exhibition in libraries and other public buildings.


The exhibit is visually striking and can adapt to most spaces. Generally, visitors browse
the exhibits for between 5 to 15 minutes. It works as a stand-alone installation – all the
exhibits have simple explanations. But it works even better if there is one or more people
on hand as “Data Detox Baristas” to explain the exhibit or give tips and advice on
online privacy.


We’ll send you The Glass Room Experience set, including:

- A set of Glass Room posters
- Pens, a magnifying glass, and a dome, and sticker strips
- A USB stick with our videoa and animations
- Full instructions on setting up The Glass Room Experience. And handling gloves!

You’ll need to provide:

- 3 tablets for the apps (although we can lend a set, if available)
- A space with walls space and/or tables – ideally around 20sqm or 200 sq ft
- 2 people to set it up – it normally takes between 1 and 2 hours
- 2 large TVs for the animations (although not essential)
- Data Detox Kits – we’ll send you the PDFs to print yourself
