What is personal data in an age when our data is everything but personal? Our websites, apps, social media and 'smart' devices all thrive on the same thing that makes tech companies billions – data. Not just any data, but our data.

**Host your own Glass Room Experience**

Hosting your own Glass Room Experience is very easy. We’ve found it works best in busy places with plenty of free space, or as part of a bigger event. It can be set up for anytime from 2 -3 days to a longer period. It can also be set up as a longer term exhibition in libraries and other public buildings.

The exhibit is visually striking and can adapt to most spaces. Generally, visitors browse the exhibits for between 5 to 15 minutes. It works as a stand-alone installation – all the exhibits have simple explanations. But it works even better if there is one or more people on hand as  “Data Detox Baristas” to explain the exhibit or give tips and advice on online privacy.
