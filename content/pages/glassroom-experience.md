*Data Detox Kit*

An essential part of The Glass Room Experience is the Data Detox Kit. Most hosts of The Glass Room Experience will be able to print their own copies of the Data Detox Kit from a normal printer or a print shop from a PDF we can send to you.

**Host your own Glass Room Experience**

Hosting your own Glass Room Experience is very easy. We’ve found it works best in busy places with plenty of free space, or as part of a bigger event. It can be set up for anytime from 2 -3 days to a longer period. It can also be set up as a longer term exhibition in libraries and other public buildings.

The exhibit is visually striking and can adapt to most spaces. Generally, visitors browse the exhibits for between 5 to 15 minutes. It works as a stand-alone installation – all the exhibits have simple explanations. But it works even better if there is one or more people on hand as  “Data Detox Baristas” to explain the exhibit or give tips and advice on online privacy.

We’ll send you The Glass Room Experience set, including:
A set of Glass Room posters
Pens, a magnifying glass, and a dome, and sticker strips
A USB stick with our videoa and animations
Full instructions on setting up The Glass Room Experience. And handling gloves!

You’ll need to provide:
3 tablets for the apps (although we can lend a set, if available)
A space with walls space and/or tables – ideally around 20sqm or 200 sq ft
2 people to set it up – it normally takes between 1 and 2 hours
2 large TVs for the animations (although not essential)
Data Detox Kits – we’ll send you the PDFs to print yourself
