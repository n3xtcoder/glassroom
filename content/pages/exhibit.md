What is personal data in an age where data is everything but personal? The Glass Room is a space for reflection, experimentation and play that provides different ways of understanding how technologies and data are changing our lives. The Glass Room puts big data on display in ways that make it tangible and less abstract. What does your data say about you, and how is it being used to define you? What do you give up in exchange? How are data and technology changing the personal, professional and social fabric of all of our lives?

The Data Detox Bar is where you can get one-to-one advice and simple tips and tricks on how to protect your privacy online and reclaim your digital self. Our staff of Ingeniuses are on hand to answer your questions about the exhibits, talk to you about the issues they raise, and give you practical advice to help you make informed choices about what you do with your data.

Mozilla is the not-for-profit behind the Firefox web browser and uses technology, products and advocacy to make the internet healthier so it’s easy to access, safe to use, and empowers everyone, everywhere.

Tactical Tech is a Berlin-based non-profit organisation working at the intersection of technology, human rights and civil liberties.
