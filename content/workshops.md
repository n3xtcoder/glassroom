    title: Making Choices in your Digital Life
    text: |
      Whatsapp, Gmail, Google Search – we use these apps and tools because everyone else does, and because… what else is there? This workshop was designed to enable you to think more critically about the tools you use, what questions you should ask, and why the answers matter. It introduced some alternative chat apps, email providers, and search tools to allow you to take more control of your own data.

    title: De-Googlise Your Life
    text: |
      ‘One account. All of Google,’ is Google’s tagline. But what does this mean for those of us who use Google search, Google Docs, Gmail, and other Google services? What information are we handing over? Are we comfortable with a blue print of our lives being with one company… and why might we want to ‘diversify’ the services we use? This session explored these questions and the question of data ‘centralisation’, whilst also looking at what alternatives we have.

    title: WTF (What the Facebook)?

    title: Boost your Browsing
    text: |
      "Searching, surfing and shopping, much of it happens in your browser. Curious how your browser (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and so on) leaves you open to tracking and profiling? This workshop focused on tools and strategies for gaining more control over your data traces, by looking ‘under the hood’ of your browser, into settings and configurations; discussing strategies of use; and exploring a few specific add-ons and extensions that will transform your browsing experience."

    title: How the Web Works
    text: |
      We are always connecting to the internet via our mobile phones, tablets and computers, but do we actually know how the internet works? Learn how you can connect to the internet in different ways, and who has access to your communication along the way. Walk away with tips and tricks, but also a good understanding of how it works, so that in the future you can figure out what you think about the latest service, platform or app and if you want to use it.
