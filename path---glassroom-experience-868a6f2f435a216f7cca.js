Generally, visitors browse\nthe exhibits for between 5 to 15 minutes. It works as a stand-alone installation – all the\nexhibits have simple explanations. But it works even better if there is one or more people\non hand as “Data Detox Baristas” to explain the exhibit or give tips and advice on\nonline privacy.</p>\n<p>We’ll send you The Glass Room Experience set, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A set of Glass Room posters</li>\n<li>Pens, a magnifying glass, and a dome, and sticker strips</li>\n<li>A USB stick with our videoa and animations</li>\n<li>Full instructions on setting up The Glass Room Experience.
