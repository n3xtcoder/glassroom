We want to discover and broadcast what makes us unique individuals when we share our likes and dislikes, our daily habits and activities, our tastes and interests, but the companies harvesting our data would rather turn us into types and profiles to be traded and learned from. The projects displayed here present more speculative and playful ways of visualising the uses and misuses of our data.

Artist Aram Bartholl compiled the 4.6 million passwords that were leaked in the hack of the professional networking site LinkedIn in 2012. Was your password amongst them? When we create a personal profile online and safeguard it with what we believe is our unique password, even those private passwords are vulnerable to breaches, and may expose parts of our digital selves that we thought were safe. Looking at all these accumulated passwords, what stories do they tell us about the groups of people with similar passwords, or how they came up with them?

Since it was founded in 1998, Google – now Alphabet – has acquired more than 180 companies and invested in a further 400, expanding its services to mobile (Android), video (YouTube), the home (Nest), the body (23andMe), self-driving cars and the world’s largest library. With the data that Google collects from our use of its free web searches, email and maps, Alphabet’s expanding empire now has unprecedented insights into our habits, actions and thoughts.

The models displayed here are based on Amazon patent applications, which give us a glimpse into the company’s storage and delivery solutions of the future. One is an urban warehouse modelled after a beehive, designed as a vertical high-rise manned by people, robots and flying drones. Its many portals over multiple storeys allow delivery drones to fly in and out at a height that wouldn’t interfere with pedestrians in the city below. Another patent, for an underwater storage facility, would save Amazon the cost of investing in real estate. Instead, products would be stored under lakes or oceans, and could be summoned to the surface via acoustic cues in airtight ‘flexible bladders’. These patents illustrate how the need for maximum efficiency is also minimising the need for human labour in the workplaces of the present – and even more so in the future.\\n\\n*The Hive patent number:<br>\\nUS 2017/0175413 A1<br>\\nUnderwater Warehouse patent number:<br>\\nUS 9,624,034 B1*\\n\"},{\"image\":\"/uploads/fertility-chip.png\",\"title\":\"Fertility Chip <br> La Loma & Tactical Tech\",\"text\":\"Remote-control birth control may be the wave of the future.

The contraceptive device, which is inserted under the skin, can be ‘activated’ and ‘deactivated’ by the user or her doctor. According to the company’s press release, the microchip would be especially helpful for women who don’t have easy access to health care, and therefore the technology has ‘great potential for developing countries’. This fertility microchip is just one example of the ways large tech companies and tech billionaires are investing in charitable enterprises, often guided by a belief that the world’s problems can best be solved by technology.\\n\"}]},{\"title\":\"BIG MOTHER\",\"text\":\"We often hear the ominous phrase ‘Big Brother is watching you’, but what about when the state is keeping track of your actions under the guise of a more nurturing figure, more akin to ‘Big Mother’ looking after your well-being? When governments use tracking technology to provide aid to refugees or when companies promote constant surveillance to ensure that your elderly relatives are receiving proper care, how do we weigh the risks versus the rewards of these technological solutions? These digital technologies promise to make our lives more efficient; at the same time, they normalise the use of surveillance in our everyday lives – we risk becoming both the surveilled and the surveyors. When methods of tracking are not transparent or visible, how can we ‘opt out’? What are the trade-offs when we give up our privacy or autonomy for safety and efficiency?

By installing motion sensors on your mother or father’s pill bottles, refrigerators, and even in their beds, you can remotely check on your relatives 24/7 to see if they are taking their medication, eating regularly or sleeping enough. The service sends you alerts and reports, if, for example, they haven’t drank enough water that day.

How long do you think it would it take if you did? Amazon’s Kindle is an example of a new economy in which the products we ‘own’ are only as good as the services we rent from them. We exchange our personal information for products that we merely rent temporarily – like your Spotify playlist or your iTunes library. In this video, Australian consumer advocacy group Choice hired an actor to read all 73,198 words of Amazon Kindle’s Terms and Conditions. At a length of 8 hours and 59 minutes, the video illustrates exactly how much time you would give up to fully understand what you are agreeing to in those pages of legal explanations. What meaning can these kinds of user agreements – which we sign as a pathway to attaining services – have for us if they are too lengthy and dense for most consumers to read or understand?\\n\"},{\"image\":\"/uploads/the_glass_room_24_10_17_12-1000x667.jpg\",\"title\":\"Iris Scanning<br>UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency\",\"text\":\"This promotional video illustrates how the UNHCR and the private company IrisGuard have collaborated to implement iris scanning – the unique identification of individuals through the iris patterns in their eyes – to help Syrian refugees in Jordan. According to UNHCR, about 85% of the refugees from the conflict in Syria seek asylum in Jordan. Upon entering the country, they are registered with iris scanning, which allows them to withdraw money at banks and ATMs without having to open an account, enabling them to access much-needed aid. It also helps agencies track those registered. According to IrisGuard, more than 2.3 million refugees in the region have been registered on their biometric database. IrisGuard is a private contractor that has three advisory board members: the Founder, Chairman and CEO of a global merchant bank; the former Head of the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6); and the former Homeland Security Advisor to President George W.

Our most intimate data, when it is aggregated into data sets and mined for patterns, is also tech companies’ most valuable asset. We want to discover and broadcast what makes us unique individuals when we share our likes and dislikes, our daily habits and activities, our tastes and interests, but the companies harvesting our data would rather turn us into types and profiles to be traded and learned from. The projects displayed here present more speculative and playful ways of visualising the uses and misuses of our data. You are invited to experiment and reconsider the idea that even if we think we might have nothing to hide, we should at least understand what we’re not hiding.\\n\",\"items\":[{\"image\":\"/uploads/the_glass_room_24_10_17_50-1000x667.jpg\",\"title\":\"Forgot Your Password<br>Aram Bartholl / @arambartholl\",\"text\":\"Forgot your password? No problem. You can probably look it up again in one of these eight volumes of alphabetised personal passwords. Artist Aram Bartholl compiled the 4.6 million passwords that were leaked in the hack of the professional networking site LinkedIn in 2012. Was your password amongst them? When we create a personal profile online and safeguard it with what we believe is our unique password, even those private passwords are vulnerable to breaches, and may expose parts of our digital selves that we thought were safe. Looking at all these accumulated passwords, what stories do they tell us about the groups of people with similar passwords, or how they came up with them? And if your password can be reverse-engineered to reveal something about you or others like you, how safe or unique is it really?\\n\\n[visit artist site](https://arambartholl.com/)\\n\"},{\"image\":\"/uploads/the_glass_room_24_10_17_31-1000x667.jpg\",\"title\":\"Data Production Labour<br>Manuel Beltrán / @Beltrandroid\",\"text\":\"How can we make ourselves useful and get paid for it in a job market where humans are rapidly being replaced by technology? At the Institute of Human Obsolescence, artist and activist Manuel Beltrán investigates how the data we produce is already a form of productive labour. Data Production Labour offers you the chance to visualise your contribution to the Big Data economy just by scrolling through your social media feed. A sensor records your hand movements as you scroll your Facebook timeline, while emotion-recognition software registers your visceral response to what you see. This system makes valuable correlations between what you read and how you feel about it. And, unlike the current systems, it will help you to get paid for that profitable labour. Could this be the future of work?\\n\\n*This project is produced as part of the Summer Sessions Network for Talent Development in a co-production of Master in Technology and Aesthetics of Electronic Arts – National University of Tres de Febrero and V2_ Lab for the Unstable Media, with support of the Creative Industries Fund NL.*\\n\\n[visit artist site](http://speculative.capital/)\\n\"},{\"image\":\"/uploads/the_glass_room_24_10_17_32-1000x667.jpg\",\"title\":\"Unfit Bits<br>Tega Brain & Surya Mattu<br>@tegabrain / @suryamattu\",\"text\":\"Who are you really working for when you work out? The information your Fitbit collects about you is not only valuable to you alone. Your doctor or insurance company may like to know when you skip the gym or take the lift instead of climbing the stairs. In fact, some insurance companies already offer discounts if you agree to share your Fitbit stats with them. And, in the future, the cost of your insurance will most likely depend on this kind of data about your footsteps and heart rate. Now you can free yourself from the pressure of always having to be active with Unfit Bits. Clip your Fitbit to a metronome, a drill, a bicycle wheel or a pendulum and generate valuable fitness data without lifting a finger.\\n\\n[visit artist site](http://www.tegabrain.com/)<br>\\n[visit artist site](http://www.suryamattu.com/)\\n\"}]},{\"title\":\"WE KNOW YOU\",\"text\":\"Initially branded as disruptive upstarts, the five companies that have come to be known as GAFAM (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft) have become some of the biggest companies in the world and have amassed the largest shares of our data. These tech giants have made themselves indispensable in our lives, providing services that are as valuable as basic utilities. Collectively, they now wield an unprecedented level of power and influence that stretches across all aspects of our lives, from work to home to leisure. How many of their services do you rely on? And how much do these companies know about you? Each of the exhibits at this table explores a different way in which tech companies and the people who run them have become engrained in our lives. They know us, but how much do we really know about them?\\n\",\"items\":[{\"image\":\"/uploads/the_glass_room_24_10_17_44-1000x667.jpg\",\"title\":\"The Alphabet Empire <br> La Loma & Tactical Tech <br> @La_Loma_info / @info_activism\",\"text\":\"When we think about the slogan, ‘One account. All of Google’, just how much information is in that ‘One account’. What exactly constitutes ‘All of Google’? Maybe more than you think. Since it was founded in 1998, Google – now Alphabet – has acquired more than 180 companies and invested in a further 400, expanding its services to mobile (Android), video (YouTube), the home (Nest), the body (23andMe), self-driving cars and the world’s largest library. With the data that Google collects from our use of its free web searches, email and maps, Alphabet’s expanding empire now has unprecedented insights into our habits, actions and thoughts. This information, in turn, is being used to turn Google into an artificial-intelligence and machine-learning company. This 3D infographic maps the company’s acquisitions and investments, based on openly available information.\\n\"},{\"image\":\"/uploads/the_glass_room_24_10_17_25-1000x667.jpg\",\"title\":\"Amazon Futures<br>La Loma & Tactical Tech\",\"text\":\"How can companies like Amazon continue to satisfy our love affair with online shopping? The models displayed here are based on Amazon patent applications, which give us a glimpse into the company’s storage and delivery solutions of the future. One is an urban warehouse modelled after a beehive, designed as a vertical high-rise manned by people, robots and flying drones. Its many portals over multiple storeys allow delivery drones to fly in and out at a height that wouldn’t interfere with pedestrians in the city below. Another patent, for an underwater storage facility, would save Amazon the cost of investing in real estate. Instead, products would be stored under lakes or oceans, and could be summoned to the surface via acoustic cues in airtight ‘flexible bladders’. These patents illustrate how the need for maximum efficiency is also minimising the need for human labour in the workplaces of the present – and even more so in the future.\\n\\n*The Hive patent number:<br>\\nUS 2017/0175413 A1<br>\\nUnderwater Warehouse patent number:<br>\\nUS 9,624,034 B1*\\n\"},{\"image\":\"/uploads/fertility-chip.png\",\"title\":\"Fertility Chip <br> La Loma & Tactical Tech\",\"text\":\"Remote-control birth control may be the wave of the future. In 2012, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation gave a grant of nearly £8 million to Microchips Biotech Inc, a private company developing a microchip that could be implanted in a woman’s body to control her fertility for up to 16 years. The contraceptive device, which is inserted under the skin, can be ‘activated’ and ‘deactivated’ by the user or her doctor. According to the company’s press release, the microchip would be especially helpful for women who don’t have easy access to health care, and therefore the technology has ‘great potential for developing countries’. This fertility microchip is just one example of the ways large tech companies and tech billionaires are investing in charitable enterprises, often guided by a belief that the world’s problems can best be solved by technology.\\n\"}]},{\"title\":\"BIG MOTHER\",\"text\":\"We often hear the ominous phrase ‘Big Brother is watching you’, but what about when the state is keeping track of your actions under the guise of a more nurturing figure, more akin to ‘Big Mother’ looking after your well-being? When governments use tracking technology to provide aid to refugees or when companies promote constant surveillance to ensure that your elderly relatives are receiving proper care, how do we weigh the risks versus the rewards of these technological solutions? These digital technologies promise to make our lives more efficient; at the same time, they normalise the use of surveillance in our everyday lives – we risk becoming both the surveilled and the surveyors. When methods of tracking are not transparent or visible, how can we ‘opt out’? What are the trade-offs when we give up our privacy or autonomy for safety and efficiency? How can we regain some agency to act independently in a world where we are increasingly and indiscriminately being monitored?\\n\",\"items\":[{\"image\":\"/uploads/the_glass_room_24_10_17_02-1000x667.jpg\",\"title\":\"Silver Mother™\",\"text\":\"Silver Mother™ is a product that allows you to monitor your elderly relatives without having to be there in person. By installing motion sensors on your mother or father’s pill bottles, refrigerators, and even in their beds, you can remotely check on your relatives 24/7 to see if they are taking their medication, eating regularly or sleeping enough. The service sends you alerts and reports, if, for example, they haven’t drank enough water that day. This technological solution can provide an invaluable service for those who aren’t able to care for their loved ones. At the same time, it closes the circuit of cradle-to-grave data collection.\\n\"},{\"image\":\"/uploads/the_glass_room_24_10_17_21-1000x667.jpg\",\"title\":\"How Long Does It Take to Read Amazon Kindle's Terms and Conditions?<br>CHOICE Australia\",\"text\":\"When you buy a new digital service, do you read the terms and conditions before clicking ‘I agree’? How long do you think it would it take if you did? Amazon’s Kindle is an example of a new economy in which the products we ‘own’ are only as good as the services we rent from them. We exchange our personal information for products that we merely rent temporarily – like your Spotify playlist or your iTunes library. In this video, Australian consumer advocacy group Choice hired an actor to read all 73,198 words of Amazon Kindle’s Terms and Conditions. At a length of 8 hours and 59 minutes, the video illustrates exactly how much time you would give up to fully understand what you are agreeing to in those pages of legal explanations. What meaning can these kinds of user agreements – which we sign as a pathway to attaining services – have for us if they are too lengthy and dense for most consumers to read or understand?\\n\"},{\"image\":\"/uploads/the_glass_room_24_10_17_12-1000x667.jpg\",\"title\":\"Iris Scanning<br>UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency\",\"text\":\"This promotional video illustrates how the UNHCR and the private company IrisGuard have collaborated to implement iris scanning – the unique identification of individuals through the iris patterns in their eyes – to help Syrian refugees in Jordan. According to UNHCR, about 85% of the refugees from the conflict in Syria seek asylum in Jordan. Upon entering the country, they are registered with iris scanning, which allows them to withdraw money at banks and ATMs without having to open an account, enabling them to access much-needed aid. It also helps agencies track those registered. According to IrisGuard, more than 2.3 million refugees in the region have been registered on their biometric database. IrisGuard is a private contractor that has three advisory board members: the Founder, Chairman and CEO of a global merchant bank; the former Head of the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6); and the former Homeland Security Advisor to President George W. Bush. Whilst the kind of detailed information that IrisGuard collects can be used to provide aid, what kinds of questions do we need to ask to understand how this information may be used in the future for other purposes?\\n\"}]},{\"title\":\"Data Detox Bar\",\"text\":\"  \",\"items\":[{\"image\":\"/uploads/the_glass_room_24_10_17_42-1000x667.jpg\",\"title\":\"  \",\"text\":\"At the Data Detox Bar, you are invited to explore the inside of the online world.
